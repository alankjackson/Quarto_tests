## A walk through the Houston Heights

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
The Heights is one of the older neighborhoods in Houston, founded in 1891 [^1]. The core of the neighborhood is Heights Boulevard, and most of our walk will be on or near that street. There actually used to be a street car line that went down Heights and ended up downtown, but that ended in the 1930's [^2].<br><br> This is a 3 mile (one way) walk through the core of the neighborhood, with a look at some of the history and many of the interesting buildings. This walk is split in two, so that you could either do a 3 mile round-trip, or a six mile round-trip.<br><br> There will also be a number of optional side-trips that will be pointed out along the way.

 # lowerRight=c(29.7820, -95.3900)
```

## Let's run openstreetmap and see how it looks

```{r}
#| label: OpenStreetMap
#| echo: false

#   Make a simple map using OpenStreetMap

# Basemap <- OpenStreetMap::openmap(
#   upperLeft=c(29.8100, -95.4109),
#   lowerRight=c(29.7820, -95.3900),
#   zoom=15,
#   type='osm',
#   mergeTiles=TRUE
# )


#Basemap.latlon <- openproj(Basemap, projection = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")

#OpenStreetMap::autoplot.OpenStreetMap(Basemap.latlon) +
  #geom_point(data=Points, aes(x=Long, y=Lat),
  #           fill='green', size=4, shape=21) +
#  geom_label(data=Points, aes(x=Long, y=Lat, label=Number))# +
#  geom_path(data=Path, aes(x=Long, y=Lat), 
#            color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1)

```

## Now let's run Leaflet and compare

```{r}
#| label: Leaflet
#| echo: false

#   Make a simple map using Leaflet

# m <- leaflet() %>% #leafletOptions(minZoom=14, maxZoom=16) %>% 
#   addTiles() %>% 
#   addMarkers(data=Points, ~Long, ~Lat) 
# 
# m %>%  fitBounds(-29.7820, 95.4109, 29.8100, -95.3900) 
```

## Starting point

We will start at the Waterworks, a fairly new development that took an old water treatment plant and repurposed the old buildings into a shopping and restaurant space.
